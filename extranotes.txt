Exceptions:
An exception is an event that is triggered when an
error occurs in a program.
The exception event is triggered by the programming
language software to tell which error has occurred.
There are:
1. Built-in Exception events: These events are
defined by some commonly known error that can
occur while the program is running.
2. User-defined Exception events: These events are
defined by the users to track errors differently from
built-in.

We use try-except to find and handle the error in some
code block by triggering exception events.

Python executes code inside the try statement as a
“normal” part of the program.
The code inside the except statement is the program’s
response to any exceptions in the preceding try clause.
